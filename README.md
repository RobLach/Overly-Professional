Overly Professional was project lead by Rob Lach developed within the Gamebuilders organization based out of the University of Illinois: Urbana-Champaign with the expressed purpose of introducing game design programming concepts to newer members.

Part of this effort was utilizing a "whiteboard" derived artistic style to allow for a highly accessible approach to creating content from a largely programmer based team.
